# 📈 Macroeconomic-Analysis

**A comprehensive data science project for analyzing and modeling macroeconomic trends and indicators.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This repository hosts a data science project dedicated to the in-depth analysis and modeling of macroeconomic phenomena. It leverages powerful Python libraries to process, visualize, and derive insights from various economic datasets, aiming to uncover underlying patterns, understand interdependencies, and build predictive models for key macroeconomic indicators.

The project is structured to guide users through the entire data science pipeline, from initial data acquisition and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced statistical modeling and result interpretation, making it a valuable resource for economists, data scientists, and students interested in quantitative macroeconomic research.

## ✨ Key Analyses & Models

This project provides a robust framework for:

-   **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Efficiently loading and cleaning diverse macroeconomic datasets, handling missing values, and transforming data for analysis.
-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilizing advanced visualization techniques to uncover trends, seasonality, cycles, and correlations among key economic variables.
-   **Statistical Modeling**: Implementing various econometric models, including regression analysis and time series models, to understand the relationships between macroeconomic indicators.
-   **Time Series Analysis & Forecasting**: Analyzing time-dependent economic data to identify patterns, decompose series, and forecast future values of critical economic variables.
-   **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance and robustness of statistical and machine learning models using appropriate metrics and diagnostic tests.
-   **Insight Generation**: Translating complex data and model outputs into actionable insights regarding economic conditions and potential future trends.


##  Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up and run the macroeconomic analysis project on your local machine.


### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rahul-bharti-2024/Macroeconomic-Analysis.git
    cd Macroeconomic-Analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment**
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab**
    Once all dependencies are installed, you can launch Jupyter to access and run the analysis notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    # or
    jupyter lab
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open to the Jupyter interface, where you can navigate to the `Data_analysis` or `modelling` directories to open the respective notebooks and files.

## Project Structure

```
Macroeconomic-Analysis/
├── Data_analysis/      # Contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for initial data acquisition, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
├── modelling/          # Contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for building and evaluating various macroeconomic models (e.g., regression, time series analysis).
├── .gitignore          # Specifies intentionally untracked files to be ignored by Git.
├── requirements.txt    # Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.
└── README.md           # This project overview and documentation.
```

## Usage

Navigate through the `Data_analysis` and `modelling` directories within the Jupyter interface. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained and provides step-by-step instructions and explanations for the analysis being performed.

-   **`Data_analysis/`**: Start here to understand how data is collected, cleaned, and explored using descriptive statistics and visualizations.
-   **`modelling/`**: Proceed to this directory to see the implementation of various macroeconomic models, their training, evaluation, and interpretation.
